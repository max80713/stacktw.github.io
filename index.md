* **Lack of Full Stack community in Taiwan.** There is lacking a Full Stack Developer community in Taiwan.
  * Front-End Developers Taiwan, Back-End Developers in Taiwan while they very suited for highly focused discussions on front-end and back-end stacks, they are inadequate to discuss how front and back-ends fit together.
  * There is a lack of resources to help back-end developers learn front-end, and vice versa.
* **Full Stack is the future.**
  * Employers like full stack because hiring front and back-end is effectively hiring two people to do the job of one full stack developer.
