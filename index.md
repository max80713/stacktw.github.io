## Motivation

* **Lack of Full Stack community in Taiwan.** There is lacking a Full Stack Developer community in Taiwan.
  * Front-End Developers Taiwan, Back-End Developers in Taiwan while they very suited for highly focused discussions on front-end and back-end stacks, they are inadequate to discuss how front and back-ends fit together.
  * There is a lack of resources to help back-end developers learn front-end, and vice versa.
* **Full Stack is the future.**
  * Employers like full stack because hiring front and back-end is effectively hiring two people to do the job of one full stack developer.
* **Hard to hire Full Stack in Taiwan.** 
  * It is extremely hard to hire Full Stack Developers in Taiwan.
  * Most developers either focus on the front or back-end, and have little opportunity to learn beyond their narrow scope.
* **Longer Career Longevity.** Developers will have longer career longevity as a full stack, compared to front-end or back-end developers.

## Mission

* Help front-end and back-end developers transition to a full stack role.
* Discuss and understand synergies between front-end and back-end frameworks.
