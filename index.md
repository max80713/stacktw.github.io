## Motivation

* **Lack of Full Stack community in Taiwan.** There is lacking a Full Stack Developer community in Taiwan.
  * Front-End Developers Taiwan, Back-End Developers in Taiwan while they very suited for highly focused discussions on front-end and back-end stacks, they are inadequate to discuss how front and back-ends fit together.
  * There is a lack of resources to help back-end developers learn front-end, and vice versa.
* **Full Stack is the future.**
  * Employers like full stack because hiring front and back-end is effectively hiring two people to do the job of one full stack developer.
* **Hard to hire Full Stack in Taiwan.** 
  * It is extremely hard to hire Full Stack Developers in Taiwan.
  * Most developers either focus on the front or back-end, and have little opportunity to learn beyond their narrow scope.
* **Longer Career Longevity.** Developers will have longer career longevity as a full stack, compared to front-end or back-end developers.
* **No job seeking / hiring solution that is completely free.**
  * Currently free solutions and network can easily be not free in the future.
  * Only an open sourced solution can be truly free forever.

## Mission

* Help front-end and back-end developers transition to a full stack role.
* Discuss and understand synergies between front-end and back-end frameworks.
* Build out an open sourced solution that is **free forever** for startup job seeking and hiring.

## Ownership

* **Full Stack Developers Taiwan** is not the property of any individual, company, incubator, or venture.
* The full stack community in Taiwan owns this GitHub repo.

## Moderation Rules

* Any company can post.
* Jobs must be **Full Stack Developer.**
  * Cannot be Front-End, Back-End, or Mobile Developer.
* Job posts must have salary information.
